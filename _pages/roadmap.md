You might be wondering what you can expect in the upcoming blog posts
that will be posted on this website. Rest assured! We'll give you a little sneak 
peek on this page.

### Daily standups
Daily standups are an integral part of the Scrum working method. We will
investigate the importance of daily standups to the productivity of a
team and write a neat little post about it.

### Team-building
Ahh, the stereotypical driver of team productivity. Team-building can be
quite a challenge in a time where gatherings of people are not allowed and
you should work from home as much as possible. In this post we will dive into
the possibilities of keeping up the team spirit while working distributed.

### Pair programming
The story goes that the best friend of a computer nerd, uhm.. we mean scientist,
is his or her laptop. But what about combining forces and writing code together?
This blog post will touch upon the effectiveness of pair programming and how it
can be done when not working co-located.

### Scrum vs. no Scrum
So, what about the _in Practice_ part of this website? Well, we will actually
have a go at interviewing actual programmers working at real software companies
about how they approach tackling issues that come up when working distributed.
After all, collecting knowledge is not all about reading scientific papers.
