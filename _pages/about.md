The current COVID-19 crisis has software engineers all over the world 
working from home. Engineers that are used to in-person meetings and just 
"dropping by" to ask questions to colleagues, now find themselves having to use 
instant-messaging, e-mailing and video-conferencing instead.

GDSE, short for "Globally Distributed Software Engineering", is a field that
researches the tools, principles and challenges of building software with
globally distributed teams.

We, a team of 4 students from the University of Technology Delft, are
conducting research on what principles and tools we can use from the GDSE
field to make software engineering a little bit easier during these
challenging times.

The website you are looking at right now is the result of this research. We
have tried our utter best to write clear and concise blog posts that are
hopefully useful for any software engineer currently working from home.
