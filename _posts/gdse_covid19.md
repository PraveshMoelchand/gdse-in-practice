# How can my company survive through COVID-19? Think GLOBAL! 

The ... COVID-19 virus . The infectious. Some countries has implemented partial lock-down while other countries implemented full lock-downs.  

During this crisis, our collegaes and us are all co-located and face-to-face collaboration is unfortunately impossible. 
GDSE (Globally Distributed Software Engineering) is o

In this blogpost we will talk about some principles in GDSE and how it can be applied to 

## Distances:

In GDSE, there are four environmental/external factors that are well studied: Geographical, Temporal, Language and Cultural. While all four factors are closely related. Effect of external factors are often studied independently, since these factors do not necessarily occur together. Therefore we think this will be an very interesting point for SE teams to look at!

### Geographical  
GDSE usually takes place at least two geographic locations on and at least different two continents. While coronavirus does not instantly send your collegeas/employees to other sides of the globe , the lockdown measures prohibits any physical (face-to-face) meetings. Therefore a link between geographical distance and covid-19 lockdown is not far-fetched.

Interestingly, while geographic distance seems to be an very serious problem in GDSE. the effects of geographic distance on coordination and collaboration have not been conclusively determined [1]. Some researchers concluded that many of the observed distance are due to factors other than the simple geographical distance [2]. Others, such as Hinds [3], states that face-to-face communication is much more effective. Nevertheless, the importance of  coordination and planning are well stated in all of these researches. Therefore it is crucial 
clarify distribution of goals, tasks, and responsibilities very clearly during. The dependency between teams should also be minimized if possible.

### Cultural and Language
Language distance (native vs non-native)  causes misunderstanding and lesser speaker acceptance due to unfamiliar accents in spoken language [1]. This effect can also be caused by the cultural distances. However cultural distances can be more damaging, since it can lead to (different) ways of task execution, management styles or even increased conflict potential. While this can happens regularly and is not unique to GDSE, the lack of physical meetings and communication (Allen Curve) ampflies the problem. To add insult to injury, some studie and surveys indicate that COVID-19 lock downs-leads to more tension and stress [reference link to news article]. 

There are several studies on how to narrow language and culture distances. Similar to geographical distance, most researches again emphasis on documentation and planning for the project. However, informal communication seemed to be an effective means to narrow the distance as well. For example, the management/team leaders can organize team members for cultural differences with online team-building projects or do daily coffee stands. These informal meet-ups should reduce the tension and stress between members! 

### Temporal
Temporal distances  are also often called timezone distances. This is an very unlikely occur during COVID-19 lockdowns. Therefore we shouldn't worry too much about it.



## Internal Factors
TODO: Write something about 4 internal factors:
project's organizational structure, the development process, communication and collaboration issues.

## Solution?
Maybe offer Distributed Agile and more communication( pair-programming/daily meeting/team building)  as solution?

## Conclusion
Conclude chapters
