Working in a team comes with many challenges. When done well the productivity and efficiency will also improve.
The first and most important factor is communication. As we know COVID-19 has
forced us in a position where we have to work remotely.
This affects the communication as it can no longer be performed in a co-located environment. 

It is important to look into alternative tools that allow the communication between team members over a long distance. 
But what tools are capable of meeting the requirements of the team? And what are these requirements?
In this blog post these questions will be answered.

## Types of tools
In general there are many tools that are used to improve the communication. As most teams will not be working all day long in the same room, several of these tools are also used for co-located projects.
We will divide these tools in three categories that will cover most of the communication needed in a project. 
These three categories look into tools for group discussions, tools for regular meetings and tools for collaborative work.
For every category we will give a number of examples and from this analysis we will derive a solution for our problem.

### Tools for group discussions
Here we will look into tools that do not require much interaction between the team members, but are always available and primarily used for asking question and general discussions.
Several tools that focus on group discussions are Slack, Whatsapp, Trello, ChannelME, Flowdock, ProofHub, Twist, ChatWork and many more.
These tools are used in almost every single project as they are often cheap and make sure that the teams remain connected. However there is more interaction required in order to build a healthy team relationship and maintain productivity.
Thus only using these tools will not be sufficient in a remote setup.


### Tools for meetings
It is important to have an update about the weekly development and create a plan of approach in order to accomplish these goals. Also to make sure that the team members interact and see each others face.
Meetings are the solution for these requirements. The best option in a remote setup is by meeting through video/audio calls. 
Some tools that are capable of accomplishing this are Microsoft Teams, HipChat, Zoom, Skype, G Suite, Office 365 etc.
Using video-calls are the closest thing next to co-located working. Most of these tools also have a screen sharing option allowing for collaborative work.
However in order to work together on the product itself efficiently, other tools are capable of performing the job better.


### Tools for collaborative work
To make sure that the communication in the team works effectively there should also be tools that promote collaborative work in a remote setup. 
These tools will improve collaborative working such as pair programming, organizational processes. 
Some tools that accomplish this are Git, Github, OneDrive, Google Drive, Trello, MediaFire, Atom, Visual Studio etc.
These tools will improve the productivity, but often they also come with a high price tag.


## Conclusion
As can be seen in previous section, there is no clear line between these categories and some tools are capable of performing multiple tasks. 
There is no clear tool that comes out on top. As every team has different requirements so will the performance of the tools be affected.
What should be taken in account is that these three categories cover most of communication needed in a team. 
So having tools that cover all these three will make sure that the communication in the team is possible.
